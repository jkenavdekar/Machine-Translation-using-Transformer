# Language Translation System 
We built a language translator for English to Swedish from scratch using the Transformer architecture refering the original paper by Vaswani: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf

Our translation accuracy for EN-SV sentences with our fully trained model was BLEU score of 23.95 beating our baseline LSTM model with BLEU score of: 9.8

The dataset was used from EURO parl corpus: https://www.statmt.org/europarl/ having approx 1.8 million sentences.

The model was built on the following architecture in Tensorflow 2.x
